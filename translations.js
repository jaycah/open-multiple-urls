                    question: 'How do I distinguish between URLs and search keywords?',
                    answer: 'It\'s simple! Our system automatically detects URLs by looking for dots (.) in the text. If your text contains a dot, it will be treated as a URL and opened directly. If there\'s no dot, it will be treated as a search keyword and searched on Google.'
                },
                {
                    question: 'Why are my pop-ups being blocked?',
                    answer: 'Most modern browsers block pop-ups by default to protect users from unwanted content. Since our tool needs to open multiple tabs, you\'ll need to allow pop-ups for our site. When you see the pop-up blocker notification, click on it and select the option to allow pop-ups from our site. We\'ve provided detailed instructions for different browsers in the warning message.'

                {
                    question: 'How many URLs and keywords can I process at once?',
                    answer: 'There\'s no strict limit from our side, but browsers typically have their own limits on how many tabs can be opened simultaneously. For optimal performance, we recommend processing 10-15 items at a time. If you need to process more, you can do it in batches.'
                },
                {
                    question: 'Do I need to include "http://" or "https://" in my URLs?',
                    answer: 'No, you don\'t need to include the protocol. Simply entering "example.com" is sufficient. Our system will automatically add "https://" to ensure secure connections. However, if you specifically want to use "http://", you can include it in your input.'
                },
                {
                    question: 'Can I use this tool on mobile devices?',
                    answer: 'Yes, our tool is fully responsive and works on mobile devices. However, the experience may vary depending on your mobile browser\'s handling of multiple tabs. Some mobile browsers might open new tabs in the background or have different ways of managing multiple tabs.'
